You possibly only need one which is default.vue but you may want more for example if you blog had a different layout to the rest of your site then you could create that here and then in the blog file you would add layout: "blog" to the export default. You could also create a different layout for the error page. I normally just modify the default layout to suit my needs but you may want to create a custom one and leave the default as it is. The choice is yours. For more info on layouts see the <a href=\'https://nuxtjs.org/guide/views#layouts\'>Nuxt docs</a>'
